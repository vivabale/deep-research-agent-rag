    """Search the web for authoritative information using DuckDuckGo search engine.
    
    This tool executes web searches to find current, accurate information from diverse sources
    including academic papers, official documentation, news articles, and expert analyses.
    
    ## When to Use
    - Gathering factual information on any topic
    - Finding authoritative sources (academic, government, official docs)
    - Researching current events or recent developments
    - Verifying claims or finding supporting evidence
    - Discovering expert opinions and analyses
    
    ## Query Optimization Strategies
    
    ### For Maximum Accuracy:
    - Add "official" or "documentation" for technical topics
    - Include "research" or "study" for scientific topics
    - Add year (e.g., "2024") for time-sensitive information
    - Use site-specific queries: "site:edu" or "site:gov" for authoritative sources
    
    ### Query Formulation Best Practices:
    - Be specific: "Python async await tutorial" > "Python programming"
    - Use technical terms: "WebSocket protocol implementation" > "real-time web"
    - Include context: "Azure Speech SDK streaming architecture" > "Azure speech"
    - Combine concepts: "machine learning healthcare diagnosis 2024"
    
    ### Query Types for Comprehensive Research:
    - Definitional: "what is [topic]", "[topic] explained"
    - Technical: "[topic] architecture", "how [topic] works"
    - Comparative: "[topic] vs [alternative]", "[topic] comparison"
    - Practical: "[topic] best practices", "[topic] tutorial"
    - Current: "[topic] 2024", "latest [topic]"
    
    Args:
        query: A well-crafted search query string. Be specific and include relevant
               qualifiers. Maximum ~10 words for best results.
               
               Good examples:
               - "WebSocket vs HTTP streaming performance comparison"
               - "Azure cognitive services speech SDK documentation"
               - "transformer architecture deep learning explained 2024"
               - "site:arxiv.org large language models efficiency"
               
               Avoid:
               - Single words: "AI", "cloud", "programming"
               - Overly long queries (>15 words)
               - Ambiguous terms without context
               
        max_results: Maximum results to return (default: from config). Higher values

    """Extract the main textual content from a webpage, removing boilerplate and noise.
    
    This tool fetches a webpage and uses intelligent content extraction to isolate the
    main article body, removing navigation, ads, sidebars, footers, and other non-content
    elements. Essential for getting the full context beyond search snippets.
    
    ## When to Use
    - After web_search identifies promising sources
    - To get full article text beyond the snippet preview
    - For in-depth analysis of specific sources
    - When you need to verify claims with full context
    - To extract technical details, examples, or data tables
    
    ## Source Prioritization Guide
    
    ### Extract First (High Value):
    - Official documentation pages (docs.*, developer.*)
    - Academic papers and research (arxiv.org, ieee.org, nature.com)
    - Government and institutional reports (.gov, .edu)
    - Detailed technical blog posts with code/examples
    - Industry whitepapers and case studies
    
    ### Extract If Needed (Medium Value):
    - News articles from reputable sources
    - Well-written tutorial and how-to guides
    - Expert commentary and analysis pieces
    - Wikipedia articles (good overviews)
    
    ### Usually Skip (Low Value):
    - Social media pages (limited extraction success)
    - Video-primary sites (YouTube, Vimeo) - no transcript extraction
    - Login-protected content
    - Heavily JavaScript-rendered single-page apps
    - Image galleries or portfolio sites
    
    ## What Gets Extracted
    - Main article/post body text
    - Headings and subheadings
    - Lists and bullet points
    - Code blocks and technical content
    - Tables (as text)
    
    ## What Gets Removed
    - Navigation menus and headers
    - Sidebar content and widgets
    - Footer links and copyright notices
    - Advertisements and promotions
    - Comment sections
    - Related article suggestions
    
    Args:
        url: Complete, valid HTTP/HTTPS URL to extract content from.
             Must be publicly accessible (no auth required).
             
             Good candidates:
             - "https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech"
             - "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.xxxxx"

             - "https://techblog.example.com/detailed-guide"
             
             Poor candidates:
             - "https://twitter.com/..." (social media)
             - "https://youtube.com/..." (video content)
             - URLs requiring login
        
    Returns:
        str: Extracted main text content (up to 5000 characters for efficiency).
             Content is cleaned and formatted with preserved paragraph breaks.
             
        None: If extraction fails due to:
             - Network/access errors (timeouts, 403/404)
             - Login/authentication requirements
             - JavaScript-heavy pages with no static content
             - Non-text content (PDFs, images, videos)
             
    Usage Pattern:
        1. Run web_search to find relevant URLs
        2. Review titles and domains for credibility
        3. Extract content from top 3-5 most promising sources
        4. Cross-reference extracted content for verification
